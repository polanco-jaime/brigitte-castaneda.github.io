The impact of oil fields on cognitive skills (education performance and human capital accumulation) is a complex and multifaceted issue. On one hand, oil revenues can provide a significant source of funding for education and can be used to improve the quality of education and increase human capital. On the other hand, the focus on oil extraction can also lead to neglect of other important sectors, including education.

In a series of 3 articles, I show the effect of the oil industry in its three main interventions (exploration, production and abandonment) on the accumulation of human capital and the academic performance of those living near these fields in Colombia.

The purpose of these studies is to provide mechanisms to develop the petroleum industry while mitigating the negative effects on education.
