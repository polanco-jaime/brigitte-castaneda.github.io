I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Universidad de los Andes (Bogota, Colombia). My advisor is Hernando Zuleta. Currently, My primary research fields are Macroeconomics and Environmental economics. In particular I evaluate the macroeconomic impacts of climate policies such as, Carbon Tax, ETS, REDD+. and the drivers of CO2 emissions and economic growth. 

I will be on the Job Market for Economists in 2023/2024.
