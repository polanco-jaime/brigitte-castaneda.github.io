As an aspiring economist, I am focused on conducting research in applied microeconomics and econometrics. I have a deep interest in evaluating the impact of interventions that affect education, youth labor force participation, human capital accumulation, and local ecosystem effects. 

By using data-driven approaches, I am committed to understanding and solving complex problems. I believe that by studying the effects of these interventions, I can help policymakers make informed decisions that have a positive impact on people's lives.

As I prepare to enter the labor market in 2024, I know that my knowledge and skills will be in high demand by employers who share my passion for making a difference. I am dedicated to my research and committed to improving the lives of others.

I recognize the power that economists have to create change and shape policies that can impact millions of lives. I will continue to pursue my passion, take risks, and innovate in order to make a positive impact on the world. I believe that the world needs more economists like me who are committed to creating a better future for all.
